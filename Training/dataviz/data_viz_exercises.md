# Data visualisation exercises

Go to [datawrapper.de](http://www.datawrapper.de) and sign up for an account. Then, pick a dataset from below and experiment with different ways you can visualise it. The datasets are all 'clean' but you may want to delete columns to make it easier.

### Datasets
Some datasets to try out:
- Prescription data (top 10 prescriptions in England, from 2006 to 2016) [Download CSV](https://sophiewarnes.github.io/Training/dataviz/files/prescription_data.csv)
- Help to Buy data (Wales, by quarter) [Download CSV](https://sophiewarnes.github.io/Training/dataviz/files/htb_wales.csv)
- Gender pay gap data (number of companies by median gap) [Download CSV](https://sophiewarnes.github.io/Training/dataviz/files/paygapdata.csv)
- Industry in Wales, by area [Download CSV](https://sophiewarnes.github.io/Training/dataviz/files/welsh_industry_data.csv)
- Risk of flooding data (Wales, by region and local authority) [Download CSV](https://sophiewarnes.github.io/Training/dataviz/files/flooding_wales.csv)

Note: You can also use the datasets that Datawrapper has to see what works and doesn't work.

### How to use datawrapper

1. Download a dataset above
2. Import the file into DataWrapper from your computer as shown and click 'proceed':

![Datawrapper 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophiewarnes/sophiewarnes.github.io/master/Training/dataviz/files/datawrapper1.png "Datawrapper tutorial 1")

3. Check that the data looks how you're expecting and there's no red in the table (as shown), then click 'proceed':

4. Choose the chart type that you think will work well for this data
5. Check the 'refine' button because that gives you a lot more options for changing how the chart looks, and the chart will update as you play around. You can change colours etc here.
6. Look at 'annotate' - this lets you add text like a title, subtitle, etc, like so:

7. Note you can also check that it's okay for colour-blind people to tell the difference between line colours...

8. Click publish and embed, and you're done. You can also just take a screenshot of it, which is what I do!

### Hints:
- If the chart isn't working, have you tried *transposing* the data?
- What relationship are you trying to show? What's the best way of showing it?
- Have a look at the [FT's Visual Vocabulary](http://www.ft.com/vocabulary) to get some inspiration! Not every chart here is available on Datawrapper though.
