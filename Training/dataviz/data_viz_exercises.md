# Data visualisation exercises

Go to [datawrapper.de](http://www.datawrapper.de) and sign up for an account. Then, pick a dataset from below and experiment with different ways you can visualise it. The datasets are all 'clean' but you may want to delete columns to make it easier.

Some datasets to try out:
- Prescription data (top 10 prescriptions in England, from 2006 to 2016) [Download CSV](https://sophiewarnes.github.io/Training/datavizfiles/prescription_data.csv)
- Help to Buy data (Wales, by quarter) [Download CSV](https://sophiewarnes.github.io/Training/datavizfiles/htb_wales.csv)
- Gender pay gap data (number of companies by median gap) [Download CSV](https://sophiewarnes.github.io/Training/Files/paygapdata.csv)
- Industry in Wales, by area [Download CSV](https://sophiewarnes.github.io/Training/datavizfiles/welsh_industry_data.csv)
- Risk of flooding data (Wales, by region and local authority) [Download CSV](https://sophiewarnes.github.io/Training/datavizfiles/flooding_wales.csv)

Note: You can also use the datasets that Datawrapper has to see what works and doesn't work.

**Hints**:
- If the chart isn't working, have you tried *transposing* the data?
- What relationship are you trying to show? What's the best way of showing it?
- We can't easily use the maps on Datawrapper with these datasets, so don't try to create maps
