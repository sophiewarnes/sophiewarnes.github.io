You might be wanting to know a little more about me. Here is my [basic CV/resume](https://sophiewarnes.github.io/CV/warnes-cv.html "Sophie Warnes' CV"), but I have another with a little more detail if you're interested.

I write an awesome data visualisation and data journalism newsletter called Fair Warning, that gets sent out every Sunday morning. Feel free to [subscribe to Fair Warning](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/FairWarning). You can also support the newsletter by [buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/A101LKE "Buy Soph a coffee") or [becoming a Patron through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/fairwarning "Become a Fair Warning Patron").

I've started writing some [tutorials](https://sophiewarnes.github.io/Training "Soph's Training Tutorials") hosted right here on GitHub.

The best way of getting in touch with me is [through Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/SophieWarnes "@SophieWarnes on Twitter") or [through my website](http://www.sophiewarnes.com "sophiewarnes.com").
