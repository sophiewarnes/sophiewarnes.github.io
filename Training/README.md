# Tutorials, Training, and Resources

**Tutorials**
- I wrote a [tutorial for High Charts](https://sophiewarnes.github.io/Training/Highcharts/index.html "High Charts Tutorial") for CIJ Summer 2018

**Training**
- I put together a [data visualisation exercise](https://sophiewarnes.github.io/Training/dataviz/data_viz_exercises.html "Data visualisation exercises") for people new to the field, including downloadable datasets, and help for getting started

**Resources**
- I wrote about [visual encoding and what it means](https://medium.com/@sophiewarnes/whats-visual-encoding-in-data-viz-and-why-is-it-important-7406bc88b4b4) on Medium
- I gathered a list of resources that can help you [design for data visualisation](https://medium.com/@sophiewarnes/designing-for-data-visualisation-e1cd4a42fa3b)
