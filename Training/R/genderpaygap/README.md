# Exploring the gender pay gap using R

### Requirements
* RStudio. This is the best tool to download packages, create and edit R scripts, as well as maintain projects. It's open source, free to use, and highly customisable. It's awesome. [Download it from RStudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* Patience. I find R quite intuitive but sometimes you might make a tiny mistake that you'll figure out later and want to kick yourself for. It's ok, we've all been there.
* Enthusiasm is always appreciated!

### What are we doing?
We're going to do a bit of cleaning and analysis of [gender pay gap data from the gov.uk website](https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/ "Gender Pay Gap Statistics"), and we'll try to see what we can visualise at the end.
