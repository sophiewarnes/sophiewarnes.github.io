### Resources needed for this tutorial
For this small project, we are going to be visualising gender pay gap data as collected by the government. You can find the most up-to-date gender pay gap data [on the gov.uk website]("https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/" Gender Pay Gap Statistics) but the data was quite messy. For the purposes of what we want to do today, I've cleaned up the data, which you can download: [Download the GPG data](./Files/UKGPG-17-18.csv "UK Gender Pay Gap Data")


### More info about encoding

If you are interested in reading any further about encoding - what I discussed in the presentation was very brief - O'Reilly has a [great chapter on encoding](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-visualizations/9781449314774/ch04.html "Designing Data Visualizations: Choose Appropriate Visual Encodings") which includes this really helpful resource:
