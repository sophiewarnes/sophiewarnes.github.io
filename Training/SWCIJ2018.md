### More info about encoding

If you are interested in reading any further about encoding - what I discussed in the presentation was very brief - O'Reilly has a [great chapter on encoding](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-visualizations/9781449314774/ch04.html "Designing Data Visualizations: Choose Appropriate Visual Encodings") which includes this really helpful resource:
![Understanding different types of data and encoding](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-visualizations/9781449314774/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages898026.png "Understanding different types of data and encoding")
